 <title>Step 6. Verify Modified Safety Valves</title>
 <shortdesc>When you upgrade, Cloudera Manager updates the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        configuration properties for you. However, if you modified any of the <uicontrol>Advanced
            Configuration Snippet (Safety Valve) properties</uicontrol> in Cloudera Manager for the
        previous <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
        /> version, those values override any property settings in the new configuration files. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>You must compare the new configuration files shipped with the parcel in
                <codeph>/opt/cloudera/parcels/STREAMSETS</codeph> with your modified safety valves
            and update the safety valves as needed to include any new properties.</p>
        <p>For example, if you used the <uicontrol>Data Collector Advanced Configuration Snippet
                (Safety Valve) for sdc.properties</uicontrol> to override the
                <codeph>system.stagelibs.blacklist</codeph> property, you must add any new stage
            libraries listed in the blacklist property in the new <codeph>sdc.properties</codeph>
            file to the overridden property in the safety valve.</p>
